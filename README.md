:hammer_and_wrench: I'm DangDieu and **I am living with analytics!** 

- I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in accounting.  I personally have a solid finance and business background  I'm an advanced Excel user with almost 2 years woking as -Accounting assistant.
- I am skilled in **```SQL```**, **```Python```** and visualisation tools such as **```Power BI```**
- I passionate about studying how to improve performance every single day. 
- I am seeking to **leverage my analytical skills ** to improve corporate performance as an analyst. 

**My philosophy:**

**```I believe that with the right education and dedication, nothing is impossible!```***
<br>
 If I want something very very much , I make all the efforts, decisions and live with it. I donâ€™t stop persisting until I achieve this goal. Thereâ€™s nothing magical or mystique about it but pure math probability based on increased determination, decisiveness, effort and luck!
